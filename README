I. INTRODUCTION
=====================================================================
Dewhiten is a small utility for formatting white space in code
source files. It removes extraneous white space at the ends of lines,
extraneous blank lines at the end of files, and formats indentation
for blank lines elsewhere in a file.

Dewhiten was written in Haskell around June and July of 2011. Its
author is Elliot Cameron (http://www.3noch.com/). You can access
the git repository at git@github.com:3noch/Dewhiten.git.

II. DEPENDENCIES
=====================================================================
Dewhiten has been tested with Glasgow Haskell Compiler 6.12.1. 

It requires the following cabal packages:

    1. System.FilePath.Glob (http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Glob)
       Install this package like this
           $ cabal update
           $ cabal install Glob


=====================================================================
III. BUILDING
=====================================================================
To build dewhiten, use the following command:

    $ ghc -o dewhiten --make Dewhiten

Then run it like this

    $ ./dewhiten


If you have runhaskell or runghc installed, you can also run dewhiten
without compiling it like this

    $ runhaskell Dewhiten

    or

    $ runghc Dewhiten
